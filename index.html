            <h1>About Friends of Clarence Park</h1>

            <p>
              Clarence Park has always been more than just green space—it's a place where people meet, memories are made, and nature quietly thrives in the heart of Bury. The <strong>Friends of Clarence Park</strong> is a community group made up of local residents, park users, and volunteers who care deeply about this shared space.
            </p>

            <p>
              We're a constituted organisation with a dedicated committee, working together to improve the park and its facilities for everyone. From restoring pathways to planting wildflowers, our plans aim to make Clarence Park even more welcoming, accessible, and full of life.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a formal group, we're able to apply for funding to support our projects—whether it's upgrading play areas, hosting community events, or enhancing biodiversity. But we can't do it alone.
            </p>

            <div class="volunteer-callout">
              <h2>🌼 Want to Get Involved?</h2>
              <p>
                If you love Clarence Park and can spare a few hours now and then, we'd be thrilled to have your help. Whether you're a keen gardener, a history buff, or just someone who enjoys a good cuppa and a chat, there's a place for you here.

            </header>

            <p>On a summer’s day in July 1888, the town of Bury welcomed Prince Albert Victor with flags, music, and heartfelt pride. His visit marked the official opening of two new recreation grounds—Walmersley Road and Rochdale Road—offering green space, fresh air, and joyful play to the people of the borough for generations to come.</p>

            <p>This article, originally printed in <em>The Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser</em>, captures the excitement, ceremony, and civic spirit of that day. From velvet-bound addresses to cricket pitches and croquet lawns, it tells the story of how Clarence Park came to life—through community ambition, generous gifts, and royal recognition.</p>

            <p>Transcribed and lightly reformatted for clarity, the piece offers a vivid glimpse into Bury’s Victorian past, where public parks were more than leisure—they were symbols of progress, wellbeing, and shared pride.</p>

              <h2>👑 Prince Albert Victor at Bury</h2>
              <h3>Opening of Recreation Grounds</h3>

              <p>Lancashire has been highly favoured in the matter of Royal visits of late. Her Majesty the Queen about two years ago honoured Liverpool with her presence on the occasion of the opening of the exhibition there.</p>

              <p>Last year the Prince and Princess of Wales paid a visit extending over two days to Manchester and Salford when the great Jubilee Exhibition was opened at Old Trafford. Their Royal Highnesses honoured Blackburn with a visit early in the present year, the occasion being the laying of the foundation stone of the new Technical Institute.</p>

              <p>The Princess Louise graced Liverpool with her presence last year, when she opened the second Exhibition that was held there.</p>

              <p>Then it will be remembered that the Duke of Cambridge visited Manchester in September, for the object primarily of opening the new headquarters of the 2nd Manchester Ride Volunteers. His Royal Highness quite recently visited Liverpool and Southport, inspecting the defences at the former place and reviewing the Lancashire Hussars at the latter.</p>

              <p>Other Royal visits have been paid to places in the adjoining counties which need not be particularised here. It cannot be denied that royalty has manifested a lively interest in all that affects the physical and intellectual welfare of the people. Hardly a week passes in which the heir apparent does not perform some important function; and his eldest son, Prince Albert Victor of Wales, seems bent on following the noble example thus set him.</p>

              <p>On Friday he inaugurated a new sea wall and promenade at Bridlington, and on Saturday he opened two new recreation grounds at Bury. The inhabitants of Bury now possess four admirable places of outdoor resort and recreation, and they may well feel proud of the fact. They may also be congratulated upon the honour conferred upon the town by the visit of Prince Albert Victor, and the success which attended the inaugural proceedings.</p>

              <p>So far back as 1882 the question of providing a public park for the borough was actively canvassed, but nothing practical came of the movement which was then started.</p>

              <p>The question again came to the front in 1883, when Mr. Henry Whitehead, of Elton, presented a plot of land to the town for the purpose of a recreation ground. Then the corporation actively took the matter up, and after considerable deliberations a deputation was appointed to wait upon Lord Derby, with the view of asking him to grant the necessary land – he being an owner of land in the borough to a large extent.</p>

              <p>In April, 1883, Lord Derby wrote to the effect that as neither he nor his trustees could give land for a park he proposed to subscribe £10,000, that sum be deducted from the price of the land which might be utilised for the purpose. This offer was accepted, but afterwards the price to be paid for the land could not be agreed upon and the negotiations fell through.</p>

              <p>Eventually Lord Derby consented to the £10,000 he had offered being devoted to the purchase and laying out of recreation grounds for the people. A subscription list was opened, and by February 1885, the total sum received or promised was £17,000, including £1,000 from Mr. T. O. Openshaw, and similar amounts from Mr. R. N. Phillips and the Bury Co-operative Society.</p>

              <p>Plots of land in Rochdale Road and Walmersley Road were secured in due course. In May, 1887, a letter was received by the committee from Mr. Openshaw offering to present a piece of land adjoining the Rochdale Road ground, and containing upwards of five acres, to be added to the purchased land, and he generously undertook to bear the expenses of laying out the ground, and also the cost of furnishing a gymnasium. Mr. Openshaw has further given a sum of £5,000, the interest of which is to be devoted to the maintenance of the ground.</p>

              <h3>Arrival of the Prince</h3>

              <p>The grounds being ready for opening it was naturally felt by the authorities that some distinguished person should be invited to perform the inaugural ceremony. It was decided to ask Prince Albert Victor of Wales to visit the borough for the purpose, and his Royal Highness, after a little hesitation, consented to do so.</p>

              <p>Then the preparations for the important and interesting event began and were carried out in real earnest. The inhabitants determined to make the day as far as possible a memorable one. All classes combined in the laudable enterprise, and everybody looked forward to the visit of the Prince with the most lively interest.</p>

              <p>The results of this loyal enthusiasm were seen in the festive appearance of the streets on Saturday. They made a brave show of flags, bright streamers, Venetian masts, triumphal arches, shields and other decorative features. Tokens of rejoicings in fact, met the eye at every turn.</p>

              <p>The fronts of houses on the line of route marked out for the procession to pass through were for the most part set off either with festoons of evergreens and artificial flowers, shields, mottoes, or crimson cloth, and strips of bunting of various bright colours.</p>

              <p>The principal streets were thronged by 10 o’clock, and the crowds were gradually increased by people coming in from various places in the neighbourhood. Railway trains brought in heavy contingents, and as noon approached the thoroughfares in the centre of the town became almost impassable.</p>

              <p>At 12 o’clock the Mayor (Alderman Horridge), who wore his official robes, received his invited guests in the reception room of the town hall. Amongst these we noticed the High Sheriff (Mr. Oliver Heywood), Alderman Sir J. J. Harwood (Mayor of Manchester), the Right Rev. Dr. Vaughan (Roman Catholic Bishop of Salford), the Under-sheriff (Mr. Walter Gregg), the Right Hon. Sir Henry James, Q.C., M.P., Mr. I. Hoyle, M.P, Colonel O. O. Walker, Colonel F. L. Edridge, Lieutenant-colonel Moorsom, Colonel C. Walker, the Mayors of Rochdale, Heywood, Middleton, and Bolton. Colonel Hutchinson, Major R. G. Randall, Mr J. Kenyon, Mr. W. Talbot (Deputy Town-clerk of Manchester), Mr. G. Lawson, Mr. R. Walker, Mr. J. Whitehead, Mr. A. Bealy, Mr. T. Aitken, Mr. T. Stater, Mr. E. G. Wrigley, and Mr. J. W. Kenyon.</p>

              <p>At a quarter past 12 the Mayor and his guests entered open carriages, which were drawn up in front of the Town Hall, and drove to Knowsley Street Station, being proceeded and followed by mounted police officers.</p>

              <p>Outside the station an escort of the 9th Lancers from Manchester was drawn up, and a strong detachment of the Duke of Lancaster’s Own Yeomanry, with the band of the regiment, was also present. A guard of honour furnished by the 1st Volunteer Battalion of Lancashire Fusiliers, under Major Hutchinson, was drawn up on the platform, which was laid with crimson carpet.</p>

              <p>The station was tastefully decorated with flags and gay streamers. The Mayor, the Town Clerk (Mr. S. Thorp), the High Sheriff, Sir H. James, Mr. Hoyle, and members of the Reception Committee took up a position near the centre of the platform where it was arranged that the saloon in which the Prince travelled should stop.</p>

              <p>His Royal Highness came by the ordinary train from York due at Bury at 12.25. When the train arrived the guard presented arms, the band of the regiment played the National Anthem, and loud cheers were given by those on or near the platform.</p>

              <p>Major Miles was in attendance upon the Prince, and Mr. G. J. Armytage (chairman of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company) and Mr. J. Maddock (passenger superintendent) were in charge of the train. Mr. W. Thorley (general manager of the company) received his Royal Highness who, on alighting, was introduced to the Mayor by Major Miles.</p>

              <h3>Presentation of Addresses</h3>

              <p>The Mayor having introduced several of the principal gentlemen on the platform to the distinguished visitor, the Town Clerk read the following address which was then presented to the Prince by the Mayor:</p>

              <blockquote class="royal-address">
                <p>To His Royal Highness Prince Albert Victor of Wales, K.G.</p>
                <p>May it please your Royal Highness, we, the Mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of the borough of Bury, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, desire to express to your Royal Highness our deep sense of the honour you have conferred upon us by this visit, and we offer to your Royal Highness a most loyal, sincere, and hearty welcome.</p>
                <p>Every inhabitant of the borough regards the consent of your Royal Highness to open two of their recreation grounds as a proof of the great interest taken by you in all that concerns the welfare and physical development of the people.</p>
                <p>We rejoice to learn from such acts that your Royal Highness is following in the steps of the late revered Prince Consort and of your illustrious father the Prince of Wales in being ever ready to take a leading part in assisting any undertaking which has for its object the elevation of the people and the advancement of the nation generally.</p>
                <p>We desire to assure your Royal Highness of the loyal devotion of the inhabitants of Bury to her Majesty the Queen and the Royal Family, and especially to express the hope that a long and happy future may be given to your Royal Highness, a future which we believe will afford many proof of your Royal Highness’s desire to aid in securing the prosperity of a loyal and grateful people.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>The address was prepared by Messrs. George Faulkner and Sons, of Deansgate, Manchester. It was engrossed and illuminated on vellum, after the manner of 16th century ornamentation. The style of the production of this period lends itself readily to the most artistic adornment of manuscript work, whilst examples of needlework about this time are fine in quality and design.</p>

              <p>Advantage was taken of this circumstance to provide for the address, which was in book form, a cover which was absolutely unique. The cover was of crimson plush velvet, beautifully worked in crewel silks and gold, with the centre filled in with a raised gilt monogram in metal.</p>

              <p>The wording was set out in German text, with borders taken from designs of the period carefully adapted to the text. With this were incorporated various vignette drawings of buildings erected in the grounds. The arms of Bury were skilfully worked into the first initial letter. The whole was finished with watered silk linings to the beginning and ending leaves and a neat cloth-covered and gilt box in white contained the volume.</p>

              <p>In relpy, his Royal Higness said:</p>
              <blockquote class="royal-speech">
                <p>I thank you very sincerely for the kind sentiments you have expressed and for the hearty welcome you have extended to me in the address that I have just heard read. It will give me much pleasure to convey to her Majesty and to my father the loyal and devoted feeling you have shown in regard to them.</p>
                <p>It affords me the greatest satisfaction to know that my visit to this town has for its object the opening of two recreation grounds, which will, I am sure, be a means of increasing the welfare and comfort of its citizens. It will always be a source of deep gratification to me to assist in promoting works of this nature which add to the material happiness and prosperity of the community. <em>(Cheers.)</em></p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>The Mayor then introduced a deputation representing the local Masonic lodges, and the Prince shook hands with the members. Mr. T. H. Sleigh handed an address of welcome and congratulations to his Royal Highness. The concluding paragraph of the address ran as follows:</p>

              <blockquote class="masonic-address">
                <p>To this testimony of our affectionate attachment and loyalty to your Royal Highness we desire to add the expression of our profound respect and esteem, and we hail with satisfaction the happy omen that in the future occupant of the throne of these realms we shall possess a cordial supporter of our Ancient Order, and we pray that the great Architect of the Universe will bestow upon your Royal Highness His choicest blessings, and that you may long be spared to assist in ruling over our loyal and grateful brotherhood.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The Prince replied in the following terms:-</p>

              <blockquote class="royal-speech">
                <p>Worshipful Masters and Brethren, – I thank you for your fraternal address of welcome, and for the kind terms in which, on behalf of the lodges belonging to your borough, you have referred to me, and to the fact of my having served in the important and responsible office of Grand Senior Warden during the Jubilee year.</p>
                <p>I shall have much pleasure in conveying to my father your cordial expressions of attachment towards him as our Most Worshipful Grand Master. He is, as I trust you are all aware, deeply interested in all matters relating to Freemasonry, and I cannot doubt that he will experience sincere gratification in learning how highly you appreciate his efforts to address the welfare of the craft.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>His Royal Highness was then conducted to the carriage which was in waiting for him outside the station. It was drawn by four bays, with postilions. The Mayor and Major Miles rode in the same carriage. Heading the procession were a number of mounted police.</p>

              <p>Then followed the Duke of Lancaster’s Own Yeomanry Cavalry and band; the members of the Reception Committee; next the Royal carriage with escort of Lancers, and immediately behind this came the High Sheriff’s splendid carriage. The coachman and footman were in full livery and made quite an imposing display. The High Sheriff wore the bright uniform of a deputy-lieutenant and looked exceedingly well, accompanied by the Under-sheriff.</p>

              <p>Then followed the invited guests and the members of the Corporation, the carriages numbering altogether close upon 40. The rear was brought up by another posse of mounted police.</p>

              <p>A conspicuous figure was that of the Chief Constable (Lieut.-colonel Moorsom), who was mounted. Superintendent Henderson was also on horseback. Police were drafted from various parts of the county, the total strength of the force on duty in the borough during the day being upwards of 700.</p>

              <p>The sun shone delightfully as the procession passed slowly through the town to the Walmersley Road Recreation Ground. The footpaths were crowded with sightseers, and every window and balcony was occupied, while not a few venturesome individuals looked down upon the pageant from the roofs of many houses. The Prince was cordially greeted all along the route.</p>

              <h3>Walmersley Road Recreation Ground</h3>
              <p>The ground is situated on the north side of the town and is seven acres in extent. It is enclosed by a wrought iron fence with a stone base. To the left of the main entrance is the caretaker’s lodge, a picturesque, half-timbered building. The ground is nicely laid out and looks very inviting.</p>

              <p>At one end there is a playground specially set apart for girls, and at the other end there is a space exclusively for boys. There is a shelter at the entrance to each playground. A cricket ground and a lawn suitable for croquet or lawn tennis have been formed in the southwest corner of the ground. The place will undoubtedly prove of great benefit to the inhabitants.</p>

              <p>At one point of the route on Saturday the local fire brigade had a triumphal arch constructed of fire engines, escapes and ladders, and it looked very effective.</p>

              <p>On arriving at the entrance to the ground, His Royal Highness alighted with the Mayor and Major Miles, walked up to the gate which he pushed aside a little, and then formally declared the ground to be duly open.</p>

              <h3>Rochdale Road Recreation Ground</h3>
              <p>This is the largest and most picturesque recreation ground which the town possesses, and a very fine estate it is; being 12½ acres in extent. The principal entrance, as the name indicates, is from Rochdale Road.</p>

              <p>The ground, which has been laid out with much taste, slopes gently from Rochdale Road in the direction of the River Roach. The bright green lawns are intersected by wide footpaths, and here and there are clusters of evergreens and flowering plants.</p>

              <p>Just inside the main entrance is a handsome lodge erected for the caretaker. To the right of the principal walk running from the entrance is an extensive lawn, admirably adapted for croquet or lawn tennis. Close by is a roomy shelter for girls. The girls’ playground is covered with fine gravel rolled perfectly smooth, and it is furnished with swings, see-saws, and other recreative appliances. There is a similar playground for boys.</p>

              <p>Passing on along the main walk the visitors’ attention is arrested by a picturesque mound, which has been planted with trees, and there is a rockery contiguous which is very pleasing to the eye. Walking under a rustic archway, the visitor comes to a large lawn which has been set apart for cricket.</p>

              <p>In another part of the ground there is a fine bowling green, and an Italian garden, and there are drinking fountains and pavilions which, while being essentially useful, are decidedly ornamental in appearance.</p>

              <p>The opening ceremony here was of a very interesting, not to say imposing, character. A grand stand had been erected at the lower side of the ground, affording accommodation for some 300 persons. This was filled with ladies and gentlemen long before the Prince arrived. The children from different schools in the town were massed on the lawn near the centre of the ground, and at three points among them were stationed bands of music.</p>

              <p>While the procession was en route from the Walmersley ground to Rochdale Road a heavy shower of rain fell, but it did not seem to damp the loyal ardour of the people who lined the streets in the least. As for the thousands assembled on the ground they took the sprinkling very good humouredly. The majority had wisely provided themselves with umbrellas or waterproofs, and very little inconvenience was, therefore, suffered. The sun seemed to shine all the brighter after the rain, and the pleasure of the assembled thousands was proportionately enhanced, it may safely be assumed.</p>

              <p>On arriving at the entrance the distinguished visitor was presented by the Mayoress with a gold key, beautifully finished and bearing an appropriate inscription. His Royal Highness then opened the gates amid loud cheers, and was conducted by the Mayor to a reserved space in the centre of the grand stand. Advancing to the front of the structure, the Prince said:</p>

              <blockquote class="royal-speech">
                <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, – I have much pleasure in declaring these grounds open.</p>
              </blockquote>

              <p>More cheering followed this interesting declaration. Then the children sang the National Anthem, the bands accompanying and Mr. J. C. Whitehead conducting.</p>

              <p>The Mayor said that on the part of the Corporation he very thankfully accepted those grounds for the use of the people of Bury for all time to come. The people of Bury would remember that day the whole of their lives. He was sure they felt exceedingly thankful to his Royal Highness for coming to Bury, and he must be pleased with the way in which he had been received.</p>

              <p><em>“God Bless the Prince of Wales”</em> was next sung, and at the close of this Mr. C. Brierley, a member of the committee charged with care of the grounds, expressed the pleasure it gave them to accept the care and management of the estate.</p>

              <p>Then the <em>“Old Hundredth”</em> was sung with striking effect, and this was followed by cheers successively for <strong>“The Queen”</strong>, <strong>“The Prince and Princess of Wales, and the other Members of the Royal Family”</strong>, <strong>“Prince Albert Victor”</strong> and <strong>“Mr. T. O. Openshaw”</strong>.</p>

              <p>His Royal Highness was thereupon escorted to the bowling green, and he sent a “jack” and a bowl across the greensward. The Mayor also sent a ball along the grass.</p>

              <p>Proceeding to a lawn near the main entrance, the Prince was presented by Miss Maggie Brierley with a silver spade, having an ebony handle – the work of Messrs. Elkington and Co., of Manchester and London – and his Royal Highness planted two trees – one named <strong>“Albert”</strong> and the other <strong>“Victor”</strong>.</p>

              <p>Then the Prince re-entered his carriage and was driven to the Town Hall, where he was entertained at luncheon with the invited guests of the Mayor.</p>

              <p>At the close of the luncheon the illustrious visitor was escorted to Knowsley Street Station, and he left for York about five o’clock, amid the hearty plaudits of the gentlemen assembled on the platform. The principal streets were brilliantly illuminated in the evening.</p>
